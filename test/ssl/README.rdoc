= How to update these files

These files are only good for so many years, and then they need to be updated... it is set to a very long time because they are only for testing purposes not for actual use of course.

== Generate your own CA (Certificate Authority):

  openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
  openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

password is 1234

== Generate a server key and request for signing (csr):

  openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096
  openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

CN must match host name or IP i.e. localhost, and must be different from CA's CN

== Sign the certificate signing request (csr) with the self-created Certificate Authority (CA) that you made earlier:

  openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt

increment serial each time it's updated

== Convert server.key into a password-less one:

  openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.insecure
  mv server.key.insecure server.key

that's it! :)
